    <h3 class="definition">Description:</h3>
    <p class="big-line-height">
        A <b>Component</b> represents an <b>entity/architecture pair</b>. <br>
        It specifies a subsystem, which can be instantiated in another architecture leading to a hierarchical
        specification.
        <b>Component instantiation is analogous to a chip in a socket in a board</b>. <br>
        A <b>Component</b> is instantiated within an
        architecture, and is associated entity and architecture during elaboration. <br>
        <b>A component must be declared before it is instantiated.</b>
    </p>
    <p class="big-line-height">
        The binding of a design entity to a given component may be delayed and may be placed either in the
        <b>configuration
            specification or configuration declaration</b> . <br> <b> For default configuration, the component name must
            match the name of
            the corresponding entity to be used in its place, and the entity name must be visible </b> . <br> Also
        generics and ports
        must match in name, mode and type.
    </p>
    <p class="big-line-height">
        The component can be defined in <b>a package, design entity, architecture, or block declaration</b>. If the
        component
        is declared in an <b>architecture</b>, it must be declared before the begin statement of the architecture. <br>
        In such a
        case, the component can be used (instantiated) in the architecture only. <br>

        <b>If a component is declared in a package, then such a component is visible in any architecture, which uses
            this
            package.</b>
    </p>

    <h3 class="definition">Syntax:</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-vhdl">
        component component_name [ is ]
            [ generic ( generic_list ); ]

    <h3 class="definition">Example:</h3>
    in this example let's assume that <b>my_component</b> is declared in another <b>entity / architecture
        declaration</b>
    <pre><code class="language-vhdl">
        -- Entity declaration
            entity my_top_entity is
            port (
                clk, reset : in std_logic;
                data_in : in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
                data_out : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)
            );
            end entity my_top_entity;

            -- Architecture declaration
            architecture my_arch of my_top_entity is
            -- Component declaration(assuming my component is declared elsewhere)
            component my_component is
                port (
                clk, reset : in std_logic;
                data_in : in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
                data_out : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)
                );
            end component;

            -- Internal signals
            signal internal_data : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
            begin
            -- Component instantiation
            my_component_inst : my_component
                port map (
                clk =&gt; clk,
                reset =&gt; reset,
                data_in =&gt; data_in,
                data_out =&gt; internal_data
                );

            -- Assign output
            data_out &gt;= internal_data;
            end architecture my_arch;

    <b>
        The component declaration allows you to specify the interface of the component, and the component instantiation
        allows you to create an instance of the component and connect it to the rest of the design.
    </b>
    <h3 class="definition">Notes: </h3>
    <ul class="notes">
        <li>A component declaration does not explicitly define which entity/architecture pair is bound to each instance.
           <br> If no configuration specification or configuration declaration is defined a default binding is used.</li>
