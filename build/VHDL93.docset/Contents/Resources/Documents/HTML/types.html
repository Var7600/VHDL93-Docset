        TYPES
    -->
    <h1 class="definition">Types</h1>
    <p>
        A set of values a set of operations.
    </p>
    <h3 class="definition">Syntax:</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-vhdl">
            type type_name is array [ is data_type ];
    </code></pre>

    <h3 class="definition">Description:</h3>
    <p class="big-line-height">
        All signals, variables, constants (i.e. objects) and expressions have a type. The type defines the set of values
        that the object or expression can have.<br>
        A type also determines the set of operations which can be performed on an object or expression.

        There are four classes of types in VHDL:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>scalar types</b>: represent a single numeric value, or in the case of enumerated types, an enumeration
            value.
        </li>
        <li> <b>composite types</b>: represent a collection of values.</li>
        <li> <b>access types</b>: provide access to objects of a given type.</li>
        <li> <b>files</b>: provide access to objects that contain a sequence of values of a given type (typically disk
            files).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Apart from predefined types <i>(available through the packages <b>Standard, Std_logic_1164 and
                Numeric_std</b>)</i>, the user can
        define his own types.<br> A user-defined type can be of any of the four classes mentioned above.<br>
        A value of one type cannot be assigned to an object of a different type. If a translation from one type to
        another
        is required, then type conversion must be applied.
    </p>

    <h3 class="definition">Example:</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-vhdl">
        type State is (TReset, TWait, THold, THalt);
    </code></pre>

    <h3 class="definition">Notes</h3>
    <ul class="notes">
        <li>VHDL is a strongly typed language which causes that two types defined in exactly the same way (i.e.
            lexically identical) but differing only by names will be considered different.</li>
        <li>The initial value of an object is the leftmost value of the type, i.e. the value on the left of the base
            enumeration.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="Subtype" class="definition">Subtype</h1>
    <p class="big-line-height">
        A value belongs to a subtype of a given type if it belongs to the type and satisfies the constraint; the given
        type is called the base type of the subtype.<br>
        A type is a subtype of itself. Such a subtype is said to be unconstrained because it corresponds to a condition
        that imposes no restriction.
    </p>
    <h3 class="definition">Syntax:</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-vhdl">
            subtype subtype_name is base_type range range_constraint;
    </code></pre>

    <h3 class="definition">Description:</h3>
    <p class="big-line-height">
        Subtype distinguishes a subset of values of some type.<br>
        The part of the subtype declaration is the subtype indication, which denotes some other type or subtype. The
        type_mark in a subtype_indication must refer to a type or a subtype that was declared earlier (Example 1).<br>
        The constraints given in the subtype indication must correspond to the subtype :
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>scalar types</b> - range constrains can be applied, for arrays - index constraints are applicable</li>
        <li> <b>Records</b> cannot have any constraints</li>
        <li> <b>Access</b> type may have index type constraints only when their type_mark denotes an array type</li>
        <li> If the subtype declaration does not contain any constraints then the subtype is the same as the (sub)type
            denoted by the type_mark.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="big-line-height">
        A special form of the subtype indication may include a resolution function name (Example 2). This form is not
        allowed for declarations of access and file subtypes.<br>
        <b>There are two predefined subtypes specified in the package STANDARD: natural and positive.</b> Both are
        subtypes of
        the type <b>INTEGER</b>. The package <i><b>std_logic_1164</b></i>,<br> also contains declarations of subtypes, which
        are constrained
        subtypes of the <i><b>std_logic: X01, X01Z, UX01, and UX01Z</b></i>
    </p>
    <h3 class="definition">Examples:</h3>
    <b><i>Example 1:</i></b>
    <pre><code class="language-vhdl">
        subtype DIGITS is INTEGER range 0 to 9;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        INTEGER is a predefined type and the subtype DIGITS will constrain the type to ten values only, reducing the
        size of registers if the specification is synthesized.
    </p>
    <b><i>Example 2:</i></b>
    <pre><code class="language-vhdl">
        type State is (TReset, TWait, THold, THalt);
        subtype Status is State;
    </code></pre>
    <b><i>Example 3:</i></b>
    <pre><code class="language-vhdl">
        function RESOLVE_VALUE (anonymous: BIT_VECTOR) return BIT;
        subtype BIT_NEW is RESOLVE_VALUE BIT;
    </code></pre>
    <p> The subtype BIT_NEW is a resolved version of the type BIT due to the reference to a resolution function
        RESOLVE_VALUE specified earlier.</p>
    <h3 class="definition">Notes</h3>
    <ul class="notes">
        <li> A subtype declaration does not define a new type.</li>
        <li> A subtype is the same type as its base type; thus, no type conversion is needed when objects of a subtype
            and its base type are assigned (in either direction). Also, the set of operations allowed on operands of a
            subtype is the same as the set of operations on its base type. </li>
        <li> Using subtypes of enumerated and integer types for synthesis is strongly recommended as synthesis tools
            infer an appropriate number of bits in synthesized registers, depending on the range.</li>
