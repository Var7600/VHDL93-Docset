    <p class="big-line-height">
        A concurrent statement which describes a behavior.<br>A <b>process</b> is itself a <i>concurrent statement, </i>
        but the instructions inside a <b>process</b> are <i>sequential statements </i>that execute in series from top to
        bottom.<br>

        The process declarative part defines items that are only visible within that process. The declarative part may
        contain declarations of: <b>subprograms, types, subtypes, constants, variables, files, aliases, attributes</b>,
        use clauses and group declarations.
        <br><b>It is not allowed to declare signals or shared variables inside processes.</b><br>

        After the last statement is executed, execution will continue with the first statement forever until a <b>wait
            statements</b> is met.
        <br>

        The sensitivity list is optional and contains a list of signals to which the process is sensitive. A change of a
        value of one of these signals causes the suspended process to resume.<br> A sensitivity list is equivalent to
        wait
        on sensitivity_list at the end of the process.
        <br>
        <b>A postponed process</b> runs when all other processes have completed, at the end of a simulation. Their main
        use is
        to perform timing or functional checks, based on the 'steady-state' values of signals.

    <h2 id="block" class="definition">Block</h2>
    <h3 class="definition">Description:</h3>
    <p class="big-line-height">
        The block statement is used to group together concurrent statements in an architecture.
        <br>
        The block statement groups concurrent statements in an architecture. The two main purposes for using blocks are:
        improve readability of the specification and to disable some signals by using the guarded expression (see
        Guarded).
        <br>
        The block statement is organizational only the use of a block does not directly affect the execution of a
        simulation model.
        <br>
        The block declarations are local to the block and are not visible outside it.
    </p>

    <h3 class="definition">Syntax:</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-vhdl">

         end block [ block_label ];
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        - IF an optional <b>guard condition</b>is included, the block becomes a <b>guarded block</b>. the guard
        condition must return a boolean value, and controls guarded signal assignments within the block.
        If the guard condition evaluates to false, the drive to any guarded signals from the block is "switched off".
        Such signals must be declared to be guarded signals of a resolved type.
    </p>
    <p> - Guarded signals can be declared by adding the words <b>bus</b> or <b>register</b> after the name of the type
        of the signal.</p>
    <p>
        - Without a guard condition a block is a grouping together of concurrent statements within an architecture.
        It may have local signals, constants etc. declared.
    </p>
    <p>
        - <b>Unguarded block</b> statements are usually ignored by logic synthesis tools (i.i. all blocks within an
        architecture are "flattened").
        <b>Guarded block </b>statements are <b>not</b> usually supported for synthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
        - <b>Blocks</b> may contain further blocks, implying a form of hierarchy within a single architecture.
