        An data object is a named item that can be used to represent and store data. Each data object has a specific
        data type and a unique set of possible values.<br>Constant declaration can be used in <b>Entity, Package,
            Process, Architecture, Procedure, Function</b>
        <br>These values depend on the definition of the data type used for
        that object.
        There are four different data objects.

    <p class="big-line-height">
        A constant is an object whose value cannot be changed once defined for the design. Constants may be explicitly
        declared or they may be sub-elements of explicitly declared constants, or interface constants.<br><i>Constants
            declared in packages may also be deferred constants.</i>

    <h3 class="definition">Syntax:</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-vhdl">

    <h3 class="definition">Description:</h3>
    <p class="big-line-height">
        A constant is used to give a name to a value, this makes it easier to read and maintain the code.

        The data type in the constant declaration can be of scalar or composite type and it can be constrained.<br> A
        constant cannot be of the file or access type.<br> If a constant is an array or a record then none of its
        elements
        can be of the file or access type.

        The visibility of constants depends on the place of their declaration. The constants defined in the package can
        be used by several design units.<br> The constant declaration in the design entity is seen by all the statements
        of
        the architecture bodies of this entity.<br> The constants defined in the declaration part of the design unit is seen
        in all bodies related to this design, including the process statement.<br> The constant defined in the process
        can
        only be used in this process.
    </p>
    <h3 class="definition">Example:</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-vhdl">
          constant bytes : integer := 8;
          constant PI : real := 3.141592;
          constant PERIOD : time := 10 ns;
    </code> </pre>
    <p class="big-line-height">
        The values of array constants of types other than <b>string, bit_vector and std_logic_vector, must be set using

    <p>
        In a package, a constant may be <b>deferred</b>. This means its value is defined in the package body. the value
        may be changed by re-analysing only the package body.

    <p class="big-line-height">
        Provided with the correct type, constants may be used in any expression. They may be associated with generics of
        component instances and passed into procedures.

        <li>Constants are supported for synthesis, provided with type acceptable to the logic synthesis tool.</li>

    <p class="big-line-height">
        A variable is an object that stores information local to a process, architecture or subprogram (procedures and
        functions) in which it is defined. A variable's values can be changed during simulation through the variable
        assignment statements.<br>
        A variable declaration includes one or more identifiers, a (sub)type indication and an optional initial value
        for the variable. A variable can be declared to be of any type or subtype available, either constrained or
        unconstrained.<br>
        Variables that are declared in processes are initialized with their default values at the start of the
        simulation. Variables declared in subprograms are initialized each time the subprogram is called.<br>
        The scope of variables is limited to the process or subprogram they are defined in.<br> The only exception to
        this
        rule is a <b>shared variable</b>, which may be shared by multiple processes.<br>
    </p><b>Although several processes are allowed to access a single shared variable it does not define what happens
        when two or more conflicting processes try to access the same variable at the same time.<br> Such a situation
        may

    <p class="big-line-height">
        A signal represents an electrical connection, wire or bus. Signals are used for communication between processes.

        Signals can be explicitly declared in the declarative part of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A signal may never be of a file or access type.</li>
        <li><b>package declaration: signals declared in a package are visible in all design entities using the package

        <li><b>architecture: such signals are visible inside the architecture only.</b></li>

    <p class="big-line-height">
        A port declaration in an entity is an implicit signal declaration. A signal declared this way is visible in all
        architectures assigned to that entity.

        A signal can get a default value in its declaration. If the signal declaration does not contain a default
        value,<br>
        then the default value of the signal is the left bound of the specified type. The default value is ignored for
        synthesis; use an explicit reset to get both the VHDL and the synthesized hardware into the same known state.

        <br>A signal declared with a kind statement can have individual drivers disconnected from the resolution
        function.
        This signal must be of a resolved type.<br> A register type signal with no drivers connected retains its previous
        value.<br>The bus type signal relies on the resolution function to supply a "no-drive" value. Most synthesis

        ignore resolution functions.
