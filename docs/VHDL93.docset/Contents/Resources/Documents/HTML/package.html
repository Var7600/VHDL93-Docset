    <h3 class="definition">Description:</h3>
    <p class="big-line-height">
        <b>A VHDL package</b> is simply a way of grouping a collection of related declarations that serve a common
        purpose.
        They allow us to separate the external view of the items they declare from the implementation of those items.
        <br>The external view is specified in a <b>package declaration</b>, whereas the implementation is defined in a
        separate
        <b>package body.</b><br>
        <b>Packages are stored in libraries</b>. A package is split into a <b>package declaration (mandatory)</b> and
        <b>a package body (optional).</b><br>
        The purpose of a package is to declare shareable types, subtypes, constants, signals, files, aliases, component,
        attributes and groups. <br> Once a package is defined, it can be used in multiple independent designs.
        Items declared in a package declaration are visible in other design units <b>if the use clause is applied.</b>
    </p>
    <h3 class="definition">Syntax:</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-vhdl">
        package identifier is
	        { package_declarative_item }
        end [ package ] [ identifier ];

    </pre>
    <p>
        <b>
            The identifier provides a name for the package, which we can use elsewhere in
            a model to refer to the package.<br> Inside the package declaration we write a collection
            of declarations, including type, subtype, constant, signal and subprogram declarations.
            <br>These are the declarations that are provided to the users of the package.

        <br> Other declarations (similar to those of package declaration) are also allowed here, but are visible only
        inside the package body.
        <br> The deferred constant, which has been declared in a package declaration, may be used before its full
        declaration only in a default expression for a local generic parameter, local port or formal parameter of
        subprogram.

    <p class="big-line-height">
        <b>VHDL library is a container that stores entities, architectures , and packages. </b>
        The Library contains all the piece of code that is used frequently and can be shared with other designs.
        <br>A VHDL library is usually implemented as a directory in the host file system. The library name is mapped to
        the
        pathname of that directory by the VHDL tool.
        <br>There are two predefined libraries, which are used implicitly in every design: <b>Std and Work</b>. <b>The
            Std library
            contains the packages Standard and Textio.</b>
        <b><br>The Work library is a working library, where all user-created and analyzed design units are
            stored.</b><br>Also
        user-specified packages are stored in the working library Work.

        USE CLAUSES

    <h2 id="use" class="definition">Use Clauses</h2>
    <h3 class="definition">Description:</h3>
    <p class="big-line-height">
        <b>The use clause</b> makes names defined in a library directly <b> visible within another region of the VHDL
            code.</b> <br> The use
        clause is typically written at the <b>top of an entity</b> or at
        the top of a configuration (giving access to the entities and architectures in a library).

        The item_name specified in the use clause, specifies the item that <b> will be visible.</b> <br> If a designer
        wants to have
        all declarations in a package visible, then the item_name should be substituted <b>by the reserved word all.</b>

        <br>The use clause is valid for the design unit immediately following it and for all secondary design units
        assigned
        to this design unit (if it is a primary design unit). <br> If a file contains more than one design unit, then
        each
        design unit must have its own use clauses. <b> In other words, use clauses are not global within a file.</b>
